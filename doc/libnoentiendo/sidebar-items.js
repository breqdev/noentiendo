Each platform typically has its own definition of a scancode (e.g. JavaScript’s `event.code` or Winit’s `VirtualKeyCode`), and each emulated system has a different set of keys (e.g. the `Commodore` key on the VIC-20 or the standalone `\"` key on the PET)."],["memory","A [`memory::Memory`] implementation can be read from and written to, but it can also be polled for interrupts. This is used for the PIA, VIA, and other chips that interface over memory but also trigger interrupts. The [`memory`] module provides implementations for various types of memory and other memory-mapped devices. Mappings are handled using [`memory::BranchMemory`]."],["platform","A [`platform::Platform`] consumes a system and runs it. Platforms provide access to the video output, keyboard input, system random number generator, and other details via a [`platform::PlatformProvider`]. Some platforms run synchronously (taking over the thread) while others run asynchronously with the help of an event loop (such as when compiling to WASM). Platforms are defined in the [`platform`] module. Currently, available platforms include `TextPlatform` for simple headless text-based operation, `WinitPlatform` for a graphical window on a desktop environment, and `CanvasPlatform` for drawing to a `<canvas>` element on the web. In the future, platforms for mobile apps are planned, in addition to a platform for running on a microcontroller (e.g. the RP2040)."],["roms","ROM file loading and unloading is different on different platforms: desktop platforms typically load ROMs from a file, while WebAssembly platforms need to load ROMs from a `Uint8Array`. ROM file definition and loading is handled in the [`roms`] module, with specific [`roms::DiskLoadable`] and `roms::JsValueLoadable` traits for these two cases. Loaded ROMs are represented with a [`roms::RomFile`] object, which can be passed to [`memory::BlockMemory::from_file`]."],["system","A [`system::System`] consists of a 6502 CPU and some attached memory. All computer peripherals are exposed to the CPU over the memory interface (i.e., memory-mapped I/O)."],["systems","Systems are created by a [`systems::SystemFactory`]. A system is created with some roms, configuration, and platform. For instance, the `create` implementation on [`systems::PetSystemFactory`] takes in [`systems::pet::PetSystemRoms`], [`systems::pet::PetSystemConfig`], and an `Arc<dyn PlatformProvider>`."]]};
